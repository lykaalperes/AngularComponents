## Create 50 Angular components, each with different functionality, based on the provided list and your own examples.

## First, I created a folder named angular-components for this activity in command prompt and install the needed packages

## Next, inside the src folder, the app folder is there. I created a folder named components

## Inside this components folder, I generated 50 components.

## I next created a app.module.ts to set up, configure the routes, imports, and declarations.

## Next, I modified the app.component.html to connect all of the components using navbar and routerlink.

## Then, I configure each of the components to have unique functionalities to each other.

## Last, I pushed and commit each of the components in github repository that I made.
